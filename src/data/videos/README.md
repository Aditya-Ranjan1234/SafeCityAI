# Sample Crash Videos

This directory contains sample videos for the accident detection system.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the actual video files are not included in the repository.
When running the application, it will use placeholder images and simulated detection.

For a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Download actual crash videos
2. Train a model on the CarCrash dataset
3. Replace the placeholder detection with actual computer vision processing

## Sample Videos to Download

For testing purposes, you can download sample videos from:
- [CADP Dataset](https://ankitshah009.github.io/accident_forecasting_traffic_camera)
- [Traffic Accident Detection Dataset](https://github.com/Cogito2012/CarCrashDataset)
- [Road Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ckay16/accident-detection-from-cctv-footage)

Place the downloaded videos in this directory and update the paths in the code accordingly.
