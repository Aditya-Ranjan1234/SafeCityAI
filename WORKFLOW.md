The system is implemented as a Streamlit web application with multiple pages, each handling different aspects of accident prevention and analysis.

## Data Flow

The data flow in the system follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Historical accident data from Bangalore traffic records
   - Real-time weather data from OpenMeteo API
   - Traffic camera feeds from surveillance systems
   - User-reported incidents and feedback

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Geospatial analysis of accident hotspots
   - Weather condition correlation with accident rates
   - Video processing for crash detection using YOLOv8
   - Machine learning predictions for risk assessment

3. **Data Presentation**:
   - Interactive maps with accident hotspots
   - Weather alerts and warnings
   - Real-time video surveillance with crash detection
   - Route recommendations based on safety scores

## Core Workflows

### Accident Map Visualization

**Purpose**: Visualize accident hotspots across Bangalore to identify high-risk areas.

**Workflow**:
1. Load historical accident data from CSV files
2. Process and clean the data, including geocoding locations
3. Calculate risk scores based on accident frequency and severity
4. Generate a heatmap overlay on the Bangalore city map
5. Allow users to filter by time period, accident type, and severity
6. Display detailed information when a hotspot is clicked

**Implementation**:
- Uses Folium for map visualization
- Implements custom risk scoring algorithm
- Provides interactive filters through Streamlit widgets

### Weather Integration

**Purpose**: Incorporate real-time weather data to assess current risk levels and provide alerts.

**Workflow**:
1. Fetch real-time weather data from OpenMeteo API
2. Process weather conditions (rain, fog, visibility)
3. Correlate weather conditions with historical accident patterns
4. Calculate current risk level based on weather conditions
5. Generate alerts for hazardous weather conditions
6. Display weather forecast and risk assessment

**Implementation**:
- Uses requests library to fetch API data
- Implements caching to reduce API calls
- Provides visual indicators for risk levels

### Route Planning

**Purpose**: Suggest safer routes for travel across Bangalore.

**Workflow**:
1. Accept user input for start and destination points
2. Generate multiple possible routes using NetworkX
3. Calculate safety scores for each route based on:
   - Proximity to accident hotspots
   - Current weather conditions
   - Time of day risk factors
   - Road quality and infrastructure
4. Rank routes by safety score
5. Display route options with safety metrics and travel time

**Implementation**:
- Uses NetworkX for graph-based route planning
- Implements custom safety scoring algorithm
- Provides interactive route selection

### Video Surveillance

**Purpose**: Monitor traffic conditions in real-time and detect accidents.

**Workflow**:
1. Connect to traffic camera feeds across Bangalore
2. Process video streams in real-time
3. Display multiple camera feeds in a dashboard layout
4. Highlight feeds with detected incidents
5. Provide incident details and emergency response options

**Implementation**:

2. Process video frames sequentially
3. Detect vehicles and track their movements
4. Analyze vehicle interactions and motion patterns
5. Identify crash events based on:
   - Sudden changes in vehicle position or orientation
   - Proximity of vehicles beyond normal parameters
   - Debris or vehicle parts detection
   - Unusual vehicle deformation
6. Mark crash events with bounding boxes and alerts
7. Log crash details including timestamp, location, and severity

**Workflow**:
1. Detect user's preferred language from browser settings
2. Load appropriate language resources
3. Translate UI elements, alerts, and information
4. Allow manual language selection
5. Maintain consistent terminology across languages

**Implementation**:
- Uses googletrans for translation services
- Implements language selection dropdown
- Provides pre-translated content for common terms

### Emergency Services Integration

**Purpose**: Enable quick contact with emergency services when accidents are detected.

**Workflow**:
1. Maintain database of emergency service contacts
2. Determine nearest emergency services based on incident location
3. Provide one-click contact options
4. Generate incident reports with location and severity details
5. Track response times and outcomes

**Implementation**:
- Uses geopy for distance calculations
- Implements click-to-call functionality
- Provides automated report generation
